<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Dennis Boadu, a self taught web developer and a graduate of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology where I read BSc Materials engineering. 
  I developed an interest in web development during my time in the university so i started combining my classroom work 
  with writing code. I'm not only good at what I do but also, very dedicated and committed. Combining schhol with tech is enough
  prove of how serious and dedicated I can be. I look forward to become a very excellent web developer.
